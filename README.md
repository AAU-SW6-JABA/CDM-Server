## Setting up the PostgreSQL DB:

A docker-compose file can be found in the root of the folder. To run this docker-compose file, docker and docker-compose have to be installed and running.

An example of the terminal command to run is:

```
docker-compose -f postgresqldb-docker-compose.yml up -d
```
